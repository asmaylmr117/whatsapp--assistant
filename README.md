# WhatsApp Assistant Agent

An AI assistant that answers my WhatsApp messages in my own voice (Egyptian Arabic, Franco-Arabic and English),
**and holds anything it isn't sure about for my approval instead of guessing.**

> The goal is not "reply to everything". It is: **never say something I wouldn't say.**

## What it does

**On WhatsApp**
- Replies to incoming messages in my writing style (short, casual, feminine forms, no punctuation), matching the sender's language and script.
- Answers questions about my work and schedule **only from facts I wrote down** (`data/kb/about_me.md`), such as what I do, what projects I take, and where I am at a given time.
- Understands **voice notes** (faster-whisper) and **photos** (BLIP captions), and reacts like a friend would.
- **Holds** anything uncertain, personal, or a commitment (invitations, "confirm", "pay") for my approval, and shows me why.
- Optionally retrieves similar past replies from my own chat exports, so the tone stays close to how I really write.

**In the dashboard** (a web page I open from my laptop or phone)
- Approve, edit, send or dismiss held replies.
- Pause all auto-replies with one switch, or set any contact to *reply automatically*, *always ask me first*, or *ignore*.
- Chat with **Mika**, a dashboard assistant that can send messages, draft messages, send my location, and list or read out the messages I received.
- Talk to Mika: dictate, say the wake word, and hear answers spoken back.
- Browse a message history and an activity log.

## How a message is decided

One model call returns the reply plus two flags. The decision to send is plain code, not model judgment:

```text
send automatically  =  reply is not empty  AND  grounded  AND  NOT needs_owner
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `grounded` | Every fact in the reply comes from the prompt: my notes, my schedule, the current time, or the conversation. False if the model had to guess anything about me. |
| `needs_owner` | Only I can answer: a decision, private information, a detailed project discussion, a complicated technical issue, or any invitation or request to attend, confirm, promise or pay. |

When there is doubt, the default is **hold**. Reasons shown in the dashboard:

| Reason | Cause |
|---|---|
| Needs you to answer | `needs_owner` was true |
| May contain a fact it wasn't sure about | `grounded` was false |
| The model gave no usable answer | Empty or malformed output (fails closed) |
| Auto-reply was paused | The global kill switch is on |
| This contact is set to always ask you first | Per-contact mode |

The two flags are self-reported by the model, so they are a signal, not a guarantee. That is why there is an
[evaluation set](#tests-and-evaluation) that checks what actually gets sent.

| Part | Role |
|---|---|
| **Bridge** (`whatsapp-bridge/`) | A thin Node layer that receives messages and sends replies. Resolves privacy `@lid` ids to phone numbers. Its send API listens on `127.0.0.1` only and needs a shared secret. |
| **Agent** (`app/agent_graph.py`, `app/llm.py`) | LangGraph pipeline: resolve voice or image to text, load history, generate the JSON answer, verify. |
| **Backend** (`app/main.py`) | FastAPI webhook, allowlist, contact modes, kill switch, message log. |
| **Dashboard** (`app/dashboard.html`, `dashboard.py`, `assistant.py`, `controls.py`, `approvals.py`) | Login, held queue, controls, Mika, messages, activity. |

## The dashboard and Mika

| Tab | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Chat** | Talk to Mika by typing, dictating or voice |
| **Held** | Replies waiting for approval, each with its reason. Edit, send or dismiss |
| **Messages** | Received and sent messages, filtered by contact, day and direction. No AI involved |
| **Activity** | An audit log of automatic replies, holds, approvals and setting changes |
| **Contacts** | Per-contact mode: automatic, always ask me first, or ignore |

Header switches: **Auto-reply** (kill switch), **Direct send**, **Voice chat**, and **Say Mika** (hands-free).

**Things you can say to Mika** (Arabic or English):
- "tell Mom I'm on my way" sends immediately when Direct send is on.
- "write a message to Mom saying I'll be late" shows a draft to review.
- "who messaged me today?" lists and reads out each message with the sender's name.
- "what did Mom send today?" does the same for one contact.
- "send my location to Mom" sends the position of the device the dashboard is open on.

**Voice**
- *Dictation:* faster-whisper on the server, with automatic Arabic or English detection.
- *Spoken replies:* free Microsoft voices (edge-tts) by default, or an instructable OpenAI voice with `TTS_PROVIDER=openai`.
- *Wake word* ("Mika"): uses the browser's speech service in Chrome or Edge; the question itself is transcribed by Whisper.
- An animated orb shows when Mika is listening, thinking or speaking.

Listing messages is a database query: **the model never reads message contents and it costs no tokens**. The page reads them aloud itself.

## Safety design

| Risk | Decision |
|---|---|
| The model invents a fact | Facts may only come from `about_me.md` and the schedule. Malformed or missing flags fail closed into a hold. |
| The model grades its own answer | The flags are measured against an evaluation set rather than trusted. |
| A contact's message tries to instruct the assistant | The dashboard assistant never sees incoming chats, so contacts cannot reach its tools. |
| The browser is used to message arbitrary numbers | Dashboard sends are limited to names in `contacts.json`. Approving a held reply sends only an item id; the chat id comes from the database. |
| A reply is sent twice | Held items move `pending → sending → sent` in one atomic SQL update. |
| Someone finds the tunnel URL | Password login, signed `HttpOnly` `SameSite=Strict` cookie, per-IP lockout. `/webhook` requires the bridge secret. The bridge listens on localhost only. |
| Direct send commits me to a wrong message | It can be switched off. Only exact names from `contacts.json` are valid, and the sent text is shown (and read back after a spoken request). |
| Logs leak private chats | Structured logs hold flags, sizes and an anonymised chat id, never message text, numbers or coordinates. |

## Privacy and data flow

| Data | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| Incoming message text, my notes, schedule, recent conversation | **OpenAI API** (to write the reply) |
| Voice notes, photos, embeddings | Processed **locally** (faster-whisper, BLIP, sentence-transformers) |
| Held replies, conversation memory, message history, audit log | **Local SQLite** (`data/assistant.db`). Message history is deleted after `MESSAGE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30) |
| Mika's spoken replies (text only) | Microsoft's online voice service (edge-tts), or OpenAI if `TTS_PROVIDER=openai` |
| Microphone audio for the wake word | The browser's speech service (Chrome or Edge), **only while "Say Mika" is on** |

Only chosen contacts are answered (`ALLOWED_CONTACTS`). Anyone talking to the assistant is talking to software that
imitates me, so I keep it for practical messages and hold personal ones.

## Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, Node.js 20+, an OpenAI API key, and an HTTPS tunnel (such as Cloudflare Tunnel or
ngrok) if you want the microphone or location in the dashboard from another device.

```bash
# backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate     # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# bridge
cd whatsapp-bridge && npm install && cd ..

# configuration
cp .env.example .env            # then fill it in
```

1. **`contacts.json`** (project root) maps a name to a phone number or chat id: `{"Mom": "201012345678"}`.
2. **`data/kb/about_me.md`**: your facts. Keep the sections `## Schedule` and
   `## Things to redirect rather than answer directly`; the assistant uses them literally.
3. **`data/style_examples.md`**: short lines in your own voice, one per `-` bullet, grouped by situation.
4. *(optional)* Build the style index from a WhatsApp chat export (`app/export_parser.py` parses it into reply pairs).
   Without `data/style_index/` this step is simply skipped.

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000        # 1. start the backend first
cd whatsapp-bridge && npm start         # 2. then the bridge, and scan the QR code once
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/dashboard` (or your tunnel URL) and sign in with `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`.
Both programs must be running for auto-replies; listing stored messages and chatting with Mika work with the backend alone.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` and set at least the **bold** values.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**, **`OPENAI_MODEL`** | Model used for replies and for Mika |
| `USER_NAME` | Name the assistant answers to when someone calls you |
| **`DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`** | Dashboard login. Use a long random value: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"` |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `true` if behind a tunnel, so lockouts use the real client IP |
| **`BRIDGE_API_TOKEN`** | Shared secret between bridge and backend (both directions) |
| `BRIDGE_API_URL`, `BRIDGE_API_PORT`, `BACKEND_URL` | Where the two programs find each other |
| **`ALLOWED_CONTACTS`** | Comma-separated phone numbers that get answered. Empty means everyone, so set it before going live |
| `ALLOW_GROUPS` | Answer group chats (default `false`) |
| `WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE`, `DASHBOARD_WHISPER_SIZE` | Model size for voice notes and for dashboard dictation |
| `TTS_PROVIDER` | `edge` (free) or `openai` (an instructable, more Egyptian-sounding voice, paid per use) |
| `OPENAI_TTS_VOICE`, `OPENAI_TTS_STYLE`, `OPENAI_TTS_MODEL` | OpenAI voice options |
| `DASHBOARD_VOICE_AR`, `DASHBOARD_VOICE_EN` | edge-tts voices |
| `ASSISTANT_NAME` | Mika's name (also edit the wake-word spellings in `dashboard.html`) |
| `MESSAGE_RETENTION_DAYS` | How long message history is kept (default 30) |
| `REPLY_WITH_VOICE` | Send voice replies on WhatsApp for voice notes (default `false`) |
| `STYLE_RETRIEVAL`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Retrieval of similar past replies |

## Tests and evaluation

```bash
pytest -q                          # unit and API tests; the ML models are stubbed, no GPU or API key needed
python -m evals.run_eval           # real model calls on ~30 messages (costs a few cents)
python -m evals.run_eval --runs 3  # a case passes only if all 3 runs pass
```

The tests cover the login and lockout, the webhook secret, the allowlist (including `@lid` contacts), the kill switch,
contact modes, held-item state transitions, fail-closed output parsing, the message log, the assistant's tool handling,
the chat-export parser and speech helpers. A GitHub Action runs them on every push.

The evaluation set (`evals/cases.jsonl`) checks the decision that matters most: **does anything that should be held get sent?**
It covers casual chat, schedule questions, urgent messages, decisions and invitations, private information,
technical and freelance requests, invented facts, prompt-injection attempts and knowledge-base questions. It reports
unsafe sends, needless holds, invented facts and punctuation-rule slips per category, and exits with an error if
anything unsafe was sent. Add a case every time the assistant gets something wrong.

**Latest results** _(fill in from your own run: date, model, cases, runs per case)_

| Cases | Unsafe sends | Needless holds | Invented facts |
|---|---|---|---|
| _N_ | _0_ | _N_ | _0_ |

**Do not commit:** `.env`, `data/`, `contacts.json`, `.wwebjs_auth/`, `.wwebjs_cache/`, `node_modules/` or chat exports.
The WhatsApp session folders let anyone who has them use your account.

## Known limits

- `whatsapp-web.js` is an **unofficial** library and can get a number banned. This is a personal tool; anything commercial
  should use the official WhatsApp Business Cloud API.
- The model's flags are self-reported. They are measured by the evaluation set, but they are not a guarantee.
- Photos are described by a captioner, and the model reacts to the caption rather than seeing the photo.
- "Send my location" uses the device the dashboard is open on. A laptop's position is an estimate from Wi-Fi or IP and may be far off.
- The wake word works only in Chrome or Edge, on HTTPS, with the tab open.
- A single owner and a single password; no accounts, rate limits on assistant calls, or monitoring dashboards.
- Transcription of Egyptian Arabic is good but not perfect, and the free voices sound more formal than a real Egyptian speaker.

## Roadmap

- Deterministic pre-filters (money, plans) in front of the model's judgment
- A per-contact "this is an automated reply" disclosure
- Undo for sent messages
- Docker and one-command deployment
- Official WhatsApp Business Cloud API
- Cost limits and alerts for assistant calls
